dsiPDCXListener.CSharp
==========

##Overview

This repository demonstrates the ability to interact with local peripherals while hosting your POS application in the cloud.  There are two key attributes that facilitate this SAAS model:

* The dsiPDCXListener provides the ability to send http commands that drive peripheral devices.
* Javascript that makes the http calls to the dsiPDCXListener from the client's web browser.

##Prerequisites

Please contact your IntegrationTeam member for any questions about the below prerequisites.

* dsiPDCXListener installed and running
* IPTranLT Mobile -- this is a hardware device.  With a few minor changes this example could also run without the IPTranLT Mobile.
* A cash drawer, receipt printer, and peripheral device that will all attach to the IPTranLT Mobile.  As mentioned above with a few minor changes it is possible to execute this demo with only a peripheral device attached direclty to the computer.

##Example Site

An example site is hosted here:  http://durangopizza.azurewebsites.net.

This site demonstrates the use of two DataCap technologies:  the dsiPDCXListener and the IPTranLT Mobile.  Visit the site using your favorite web browser and then click the 'Admin' link.  Enter the IP address and port where the dsiPDCXListener is running and then enter your TranDeviceID that you will find on the IPTranLT Mobile device.  Finally press the 'Update' button and then purchase some pizza.  The javascript will execute driving the pole display, peripheral device, receipt printer, and cash drawer for a full integrated payment experience.

##Step 1: Display a payment page

In our case the payment page is fairly simple.  It contains an amount text box, an option for credit or debit, and a submit button.

```
<form id="purchaseform" action="" method="post">
    <p>
        <label>Amount:</label><input type="text" id="amount" name="amount" value="1.22" /><br />
        <input type="radio" name="trantype" value="Debit" checked />Debit
        <br />
        <input type="radio" name="trantype" value="Credit" />Credit
        <br />
        <input type="submit" value="Pay" />
    </p>
</form>
```

##Step 2:Capture submit event and POST to dsiPDCXListener

When the user presses the 'Pay' button above we capture the event in javascript and initiate the process of sending transactions by posting to the dsiPDCXListener via javascript.  You will see in the code (the Pizza.cshtml page) that the process function kicks off the process and a context object provides state data for all of the javascript functions.  The postData function is actually where the data is posted to the dsiPDCXListener.

You can see below that the url is included in the context object as is the actual data to post.  The data is configurable on the hosted (server) side and then written to the context object at runtime.

```
function postData(context) {
  var posting = $.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: context.url,
    data: context.data,
    contentType: context.contentType,
  });

  posting.done(function (data) {
    context.returnData = data;
    process(context);
  });

  posting.error(function (xhr, textStatus, errorThrown) {
    alert(xhr.responseText);
  });
}
```

The data that is POSTed to the dsiPDCXListener is familiar XML with a few modifications.  The XML below is used to write to the PoleDisplay.  The {0} is filled in at runtime by the TranDeviceID configured in the Admin screen mentioned above.  The {1} is filled in at runtime with the list of data to write to the PoleDisplay and looks like:  <Line1>.Write to Pole Display</Line1>.  You can write multiple lines to the PoleDisplay via additional <Line#> elements.

```
<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>
  <TStream>
    <Admin>
      <TranDeviceID>{0}</TranDeviceID>
      <TranCode>PoleDisplay</TranCode>
      <MerchantID>494901</MerchantID>
      <ComPort>0</ComPort>
      <SecureDevice>ONTRAN</SecureDevice>
      {1}
    </Admin>
  </TStream>
```

##Step 3: Parse Response

The parsing mechanism will change depending on which dsiPDCXListener method you use.  There are four differnt methods supported by the dsiPDCXListener (method1, method2, method3, method4 -- these are the actual names).  For example if you are using method1 that means you are sending/receiving XML and therefore you will need to send and parse XML.  Here's sample javascript that shows parsing the response returned by the dsiPDCXListener into the context javascript object.

```
    function parseXmlFromDataCapXML(context) {

        xmlDoc = $.parseXML(context.returnData);
        $xml = $(xmlDoc);
        
        context.AuthCode = $xml.find('AuthCode').text();
        context.ResponseOrigin = $xml.find('ResponseOrigin').text();
        context.DSIXReturnCode = $xml.find('DSIXReturnCode').text();
        context.CmdStatus = $xml.find('CmdStatus').text();
        context.TextResponse = $xml.find('TextResponse').text();
        context.MerchantID = $xml.find('MerchantID').text();
        context.AcctNo = $xml.find('AcctNo').text();
        context.TranCode = $xml.find('TranCode').text();
        context.CaptureStatus = $xml.find('CaptureStatus').text();
        context.InvoiceNo = $xml.find('InvoiceNo').text();
        context.Purchase = $xml.find('Purchase').text();
        context.Authorize = $xml.find('Authorize').text();
        context.RecordNo = $xml.find('RecordNo').text();

        return context;
    }
```
