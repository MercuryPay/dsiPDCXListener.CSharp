dsiPDCXListener.CSharp
==========

This is an internal project for now that demos calling DataCap's dsiPDCX Windows Listener running on a local merchant's computer from a website hosted outside of the merchant's IT infrastructure.

It makes use of javascript to do most of the work necessary.

The cloud site is:  durangopizza.azurewebsites.net
